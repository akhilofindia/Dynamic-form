# 📝 Student Dynamic Form App

A React-based dynamic form application that allows a student to log in, fetch a form dynamically from an API, fill it section-by-section with validations, and submit it — all without hardcoding any field or section.

## 📦 Features

- Student login using Roll Number and Name
- User registration via `POST /create-user` API
- Dynamic form generation via `GET /get-form` API
- Section-wise form navigation with validation
- Field-level validation (e.g., required, minLength, maxLength, etc.)
- Clean and functional UI
- Final form submission logs collected data to the console
